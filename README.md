So what is the metaverse? Simply put, it's the next generation of the internet, and it's going to turn today's online experiences into interconnected, immersive digital spaces where you can interact with others no matter where you are physically. What's special about the metaverse is that in many ways it has more in common with our physical world than it does with today's internet.

# Co-presence

We call this co-presence, or that feeling of being physically together even when we're not. You might have gotten a taste of co-presence through online games like Minecraft or World of Warcraft. The metaverse takes the idea of co-presence beyond gaming and applies it to everything.
